Development in this repository has stopped in favor of:

https://github.com/drytoastman/scorekeeperbackend
and
https://github.com/drytoastman/scorekeeperfrontend

Development is going in a very different directory and 
this repository's history is cluttered with binary data
that shouldn't be there.
